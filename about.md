My name is Arun. I'm glad that you're here. 

I am a programmer, a budding artist and an aspiring thought leader in the space where those two intersect.

The rush and exhilaration experienced after solving a particularly difficult C programming problem with I/O registers for one of my first college projects, made an indelible impression on my mind and that's when I realised that I had fallen in love with coding. This was many years ago, an entirely different era, well before the Internet's ubiquity. 

I've been fortunate to have made a career in software as hoped for two decades ago. In the meanhile, I've played with many a programming language, multiple technology stacks and a variety of platforms. Looking back, everything's been evolving and in a state of flux, with the exception of the sheer joy arising out of solving problems and creating stuff out of thin air!

Five years ago, as a revival of another childhood hobby, I started painting. To limit the area of focus from an infinitude of alternatives, I chose to work on Kerala style mural paintings. That's where I built skills for the most part, however, I have observed an unmistakable mark of spillage of it into other artistic styles as well. I wouldn't call myself a professional as yet, but I have made good progress through diligent effort.

After spending considerable time and energy in these two seemingly disparate domains viz. software and art, I've started observing a surprising lot of commonalities and mutual enforcements between these two. My intuition tells me that I've barely scratched the surface. Going forward, that's an area that I wish to study and think about in-depth.

This website contains notes on software, github links to my hobby projects, imgur links to my art works and some other miscellaneous observations distilled out of experience. Do take a look.

Thanks for stopping by!
