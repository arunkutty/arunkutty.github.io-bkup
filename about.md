My name is Arun and I am a Solution Architect currently owning Level 3 support for Test Automation and Performance Testing tools in HCL Products and Platforms. 

Apart from Test Automation and Performance Testing which gives me my daily bread,
I am passionate about Web and Mobile application development and tinker away merrily during weekends and holidays.

Other than work and "hacking", I spend time listening to music and reading. I dabble with sketching and learning the keyboard as well.

I try to derive meaning in life by setting goals and working towards achieving them. My wife, I and our two boys live a content life
among a circle of good friends in CV Raman Nagar, Bangalore.
