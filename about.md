I work on Test Automation tools development with HCL Products & Platforms and am a Level 3 Support Engineer 
 for Performance Testing and Web UI Testing tools.

Apart from my core work, I am passionate about Web and Mobile application software development and 
tinker during free time. Other than work and "hacking", I spend time listening to music and reading. 
I try to find time teaching myself Indian traditional art and the keyboard as well.

I try to derive meaning in life by setting goals and working towards achieving them. My wife, I and our two boys live a content life
among a circle of good friends in Cary, NC.
