I can write code and troubleshoot software built with a variety of stacks and architectures. I'm part of HCL Software where we build test automation products. It is an exciting place to be, constantly being in the lookout for the latest in software development and adapting continuously.

Aside from being bread-and-butter, I pursue programming as a hobby too. My other interests are painting, singing and writing.

A good life in my view is one where we create meaning by having goals, being balanced while pursuing them and helping each other at it.
