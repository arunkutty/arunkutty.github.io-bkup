Starting from Release 9.0.1, the legacy reporting of RPT has been replaced by a new Web Analytics report. Apart from the refreshed look and feel of reports, there has been significant improvement in the real time performance of reporting and reduction in the memory footprint. Moreover, these reports can be accessed via a web browser with all the functionality intact. 

I wrote an article on customizing web analytics reports as the steps for doing so are almost entirely different from what it used to be with legacy reports. This article was published in the Test Workbench Community site and is available [here](http://www.testworkbench-community.com/blogs/customizing-performance-tester-web-analytics-reports). Do take a look.
